# Next-session prompt — Plotline Marketing Studio

Paste everything below the line into a fresh Claude Code session.

---

Continue the **Plotline Marketing Studio** build. Two repos:
`~/Documents/plotline-api` (FastAPI + agents) and `~/Documents/plotline-web` (Next.js).

Read in this order before touching code:

1. `~/Documents/plotline-api/Handoff.MD` — the project brain for both repos. It carries
   `last-synced` shas; run `git log --oneline <sha>..HEAD` in **both** repos and reconcile
   any drift before trusting it.
2. `~/Documents/plotline-api/Learning.MD` — root causes already found, in 5-whys form.
   Check it before debugging anything; the answer may be there. Read at least the last three
   entries — one of them explains why a whole class of bug keeps recurring.
3. `docs/v3-ENHANCEMENT-BRIEF.md`, `docs/v3-ARTIFACT-SPEC.md`, `docs/v3-COUNCIL-DOCTRINE.md`
   — the governing specs, highest precedence. `docs/v3-agentic-flow.html` is a one-page
   visual of the whole pipeline; open it first if you want orientation fast.

## Where the app is

v3 is **shipped end to end, API and UI**. 160 tests green (the floor was 83).
Pipeline: cards → **brief** → options → templates(+style block) → **script** (video only) →
**board** → **canon** → **keyframes** (hard gate) → generate → creative → **qc** → done.
All six new artifact types render with working actions; My Brand hosts the canon library.

**Run it FIRST, before anything else — ONE command:**
`cd ~/Documents/plotline-web && npm run dev`. Its `predev` starts api :8600 + rag :8788 +
devrag :8787 detached via the API repo's `run-detached.sh` (idempotent), then the web on
:3100. `npm run stack:status` / `stack:stop` for the rest. Do NOT use `run.sh` from a tool
call — it runs in the foreground and traps EXIT to kill devrag, so the whole stack dies when
that shell ends. If the browser says "Can't reach the API", that is this, not an app bug.

Observability at
`http://localhost:3100/observability` shows every agent node's structured input/output.
Use it FIRST when something stalls — it names which node died and what it was asked.

## Ground rules

- **LOCAL ONLY.** Render autoDeploy is off. Do not push or deploy without asking.
- **160 tests are the floor.** Never weaken a test or an invariant to make a change easy —
  surface the conflict instead. Re-point a test only when an INVARIANT genuinely changed by
  owner decision, and say so in the commit.
- **`.env` is in QA mode**: Haiku on all four model slots, `MOCK_MEDIA=1`. Both are marked in
  the file with how to restore. Restore before judging output quality — Haiku needed several
  retries where Sonnet needed none.
- **Never `npm run build`** — it clobbers the dev server's `.next`. Use `npm run typecheck`.
- **Ask before spending.** A rumination is slow and costs real money.
- **Drive the app like a user.** Every bug that mattered was invisible to the tests: the
  refused brief, the dropped attachment, and a gate that rendered as a placeholder with no
  buttons while 155 tests and two API QA runs passed.

## Start here — pick with the owner

1. **fal is untested under v3.** Balance was low, so `MOCK_MEDIA=1` throughout — generate,
   creative, keyframes and canon are verified for WIRING only. No real image or video has
   rendered under v3. Biggest unknown in the build.
2. **The reject UI is server-side only.** `reject_<cause>_<slot>` works and is tested, but
   `CreativeSetCard` does not offer the five causes as buttons, so a user can only re-roll.
3. **`keyframes_per_shot` is stored and shown but not consumed** — the renderer loop makes
   one frame per shot regardless.
4. **Canon views use the draft tier and a generic per-view prompt.** Enough to prove
   coverage; a real sheet wants its own brief + locks in each view prompt.
5. **Style block has no editable card** — read-only on the board card; §3 asks for six
   editable rows and a copy action.
6. 🔴 **P0-2, still open and costing money:** Render is live and public with a real
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `FAL_KEY` and **no auth**. Decide: suspend, add auth, or flip to
   mock. Warn the owner that flipping `MOCK_LLM=1` would ALSO open `/api/agent-runs`
   publicly — that gate couples two unrelated concerns and should be its own env var.

## Invariants that must survive every change

Cost shown **before** any generation plus an explicit user event; **no setting removes a cost
gate** (`generate` is deliberately absent from `GATEABLE_STAGES`, and naming it is an error,
not a no-op); editable prompts used **verbatim**; per-asset re-roll only; **no video without
every keyframe approved**; a gate mode controls whether the flow PAUSES, never whether the
artifact is PRODUCED; confirmed claims are the compliance source of truth and an unmapped
claim is a kill flag; **an unrun check renders as `skip`/`na`, never as `pass`**; honesty
surfaces everywhere; labeled working steps, never a bare spinner; ≤1 clarifying question per
turn; `AgentMessage.text` ≤ 2 sentences with content in artifacts; the `generation_log` audit
stays reachable.

## The bug class that keeps recurring — read before adding any check

Four times now ONE FACT had TWO REPRESENTATIONS and nothing compared them: the R2 receipt
lexicon (prompt vs validator), the W1 words-per-second table and the B3 reference caps
(prompt vs config), and `CAMPAIGN_ARTIFACT_TYPES` vs the renderer switch (list vs switch,
across a language boundary — that one made a gate a dead end in the UI while every API test
passed).

So: **when a check is mechanical, the prompt must QUOTE the mechanism, generated from the
same constant the check reads** — see `validators.script_thresholds_text()` and
`ref_slots_text()`, injected via `prompt_replacements`. Never hand-copy. And when two lists
must agree, something has to compare them in the suite that actually runs, even if that means
a Python test reading TypeScript
(`test_every_artifact_the_server_emits_has_a_renderer_registered`).

The W1 table carries the ARITHMETIC, not just the ceiling ("a 10-word line needs at least
3.0s"), because a model can hold a threshold and still not see its own line breaks it. Do not
simplify that back to a bare number.

## Where things live

- Orchestration: `app/campaign.py` (`CAMPAIGN_STAGES` + `advance_from()`, turn handlers) and
  `app/graph.py` (plan → review → one-pass refine, per-node checkpoints). The linear stages
  stay plain code on purpose — see the 2026-08-25 decision.
- Every LLM call: `app/agents/runner.py::run_agent` (streaming, validation retries,
  truncation guard, transport retry, raw-body capture to `data/runs/raw/`).
- The reviewer: `app/agents/council.py` — ONE Marketing Expert, no retrieval, frozen doctrine.
  Stakeholder seats are an additive opt-in via `app/seats.py`.
- Validators: `app/validators.py` (W1-W3 script lints, B1-B4 board lints, canon, keyframe
  gate, QC, doctrine enforcement). Retrieval: `app/tools.py` + `app/rag_client.py`.
- Prompts (all live): `prompts/shared_policy.md` (prepended to every agent),
  `campaign_intake.md`, `campaign_planner.md`, `campaign_brief.md`, `hook_rack.md`,
  `shot_board.md`, `canon_plan.md`, `council/doctrine.md`, `council/marketing_expert.md`.
- UI: `plotline-web/components/campaign-artifacts.tsx` (all campaign cards — note the TWO
  lists at the top), `app/brand/page.tsx` (canon library),
  `app/studio/thread/[threadId]/page.tsx`.

Update `Handoff.MD` before each checkpoint commit and at phase end, and re-stamp
`last-synced`. Log root causes in `Learning.MD`.
