"""The rumination pipeline as an explicit LangGraph StateGraph.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
`app/campaign.py` drove rumination as straight-line Python: plan, then three
seats in a for-loop, then the chair, then an `if flagged:` refine block. That
works, but it hides the two things that are actually interesting about the
flow — that the seats are INDEPENDENT (they can run concurrently, and their
blindness is a structural fact, not a convention) and that the refine loop is a
CONDITIONAL EDGE with a hard cap of one pass.

Modelling it as a graph makes both machine-checkable instead of
convention-checkable:

  * the three seats are three nodes fanned out from one edge, so "blind" means
    "no edge carries another seat's output", not "we remembered not to pass it"
  * the refine cap is `refine_done` in the state and a conditional edge that
    can only route to refine once — not an `if` a future edit could loosen
  * every node returns a Pydantic-validated slice of state, so an invalid
    intermediate cannot travel down an edge

WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT CHANGE
------------------------------------
The agents, prompts, validators, CCS recomputation and citation checks are
untouched — this module calls the SAME `run_agent`, the SAME
`validate_feedback`, the SAME `_dispatcher`. A graph that quietly changed the
rules would make the 19 acceptance checks meaningless. Rumination is the piece
being ported first because it is the piece with genuine graph shape; the linear
stages (name -> paths -> cards, and detail -> generate -> creative) are a state
machine over user events, and a StateGraph would add ceremony without adding
truth.
