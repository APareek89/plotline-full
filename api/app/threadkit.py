"""Thread plumbing shared by every driver — envelope, locks, labeled steps,
per-thread workspace, retrieval dispatcher, feedback merge, cost units.

This module exists so the Marketing Studio driver (app/campaign.py) does not
import from the drivers it replaces. Before this, campaign.py reached into
app/thread.py, app/creative.py and app/orchestrator.py for helpers that were
never Content-Studio- or Creative-Studio-specific — which meant the old
drivers could not be deleted without breaking the new one.

Nothing here knows about a product surface. The old drivers re-export these
names so they keep working until they are removed; when they go, this module
is the only definition and nothing else moves.
