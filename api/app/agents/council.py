"""The reviewer — one Marketing Expert who judges the planner's draft.

v3.2 (owner decision 2026-08-25): "after planner only one agent (Marketing
expert) reviewing the plan and giving feedback to planner for refinement."

WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY
---------------------------
Three blind seats plus a chair. Four LLM calls whose combined product was one
`Feedback` object: the seats each judged through one lens, and the chair's whole
job was to merge them back together. On the production models that shape cost
most of a ~15 minute rumination — roughly two minutes per seat and nearly eight
for the chair, because consolidating three full reviews is a big generation.

The Marketing Expert carries all three lenses and emits `Feedback` directly, so
the consolidation step is removed rather than made faster. The refine loop, the
CCS recomputation, the kill flags and every validator are untouched: the same
schema arrives at the same checks, from one call instead of four.

WHAT SURVIVED
-------------
The frozen doctrine (`prompts/council/doctrine.md`) — still the reviewer's only
knowledge, still no retrieval, still PRINCIPLE/model citations only. The planner
keeps its RAG: the corpus informs the draft, the doctrine judges it.

Stakeholder seats survive too, as an ADDITIVE opt-in (doctrine §7, the agency
sale). None configured — the default — is one agent and one call. Configure a
client's reviewer and it runs first; the Marketing Expert then treats it as one
more opinion to judge, never to average.
