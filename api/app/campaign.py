"""Addendum-03 (v2 Marketing Studio) — the campaign thread driver.

Steps 3-8 of the owner's flow live here: rumination → campaign options
(planner + Agent Council) → templates → campaign detail in the right panel →
refine loop → model-confirm → generation → Ad Card. Steps 0-2 arrive through
start_campaign() and save_block(); path a (cards) and path b (conversation)
write the IDENTICAL CampaignContext — path b is elicitation UX, not a second
data model.

An in-memory per-thread workspace (app/threadkit.py), long work on
a daemon thread with labeled _working steps (never a bare spinner), honest
error cards. The durable record is thread_messages + assets + generation_log +
ad_cards; a process restart loses the workspace, not the audit trail.

Invariants enforced HERE, not in prompts (prompts drift, code doesn't):
cost + an explicit UserEvent before any generation; the single-vs-variants
question always precedes it; user-edited prompts used VERBATIM; per-asset
re-roll only; claims_used ⊆ the CONFIRMED approved claims; Skip on templates
means NO style constraint; typed commands and buttons are the same signal.

# --------------------------------- council adapter (documented, not a hack) --
#
# The council + validate_feedback speak Plan/Feedback (v1 concept mechanics:
# element verdicts, lenses, kill flags, server-recomputed CCS). A CampaignOption
# is not a Concept, and the v1 Feedback validator has no option-shaped mode.
# Rather than weaken the validator, this file maps each option onto a SHADOW
# concept so the whole v1 judging machine applies unchanged:
#   * option_id  → concept id (verdict ids line up)
#   * element_scores stay EMPTY — options genuinely carry no planner
#     self-ratings, which is exactly the blindness the council requires
#   * the verbatim options travel beside the shadow plan in the payload, so no
#     seat ever judges the truncated copy
# Nothing about validate_feedback is relaxed: every citation still resolves,
# every applicable element still needs a verdict, CCS is still server-computed.
