"""The council's seat registry.

Seats used to be a hardcoded three-value list. v3 makes them a registry so an
agency can define a seat for *their client's* reviewer ("my_cmo") — the feature
the doctrine calls the agency sale. A seat is a prompt file plus two facts:
whether it is built in, and whether it may hold a kill flag.

DEPENDENCY NOTE. This module reads prompt headers itself instead of calling
`runner.load_prompt`, because `runner` imports `validators` and `validators`
imports this registry — routing through runner would close that loop. The parse
here is deliberately tiny: a header comment, not a format.

# v3.2 — ONE reviewer by default (owner decision 2026-08-25: "after planner only
# one agent reviewing the plan and giving feedback to planner for refinement").
#
# The three blind seats plus a chair were four sequential-ish LLM calls whose
# only job was to be recombined into one Feedback. On the production models that
# was most of a ~15 minute rumination — three seats at roughly two minutes each
# and a chair at nearly eight. The Marketing Expert carries all three lenses and
# emits that Feedback directly, so the consolidation step disappears rather than
# being done faster.

# remain available and ADDITIVE — configure one and it runs first, and the
# reviewer treats it as one more opinion to judge (never to average).
